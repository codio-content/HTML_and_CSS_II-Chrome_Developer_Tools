## To add styles

You can also add properties on an element. Here we will add `width:30%` to the `img`.

1. Either you click just underneath the last property (under `border-radius` here) and it will add a new property.
1. Or you click on the last property value (here `49px;`) to select it and hit the "Tab" key and it will add a new empty property.
1. Then you start typing the property name, here we type "wid" then it offers the possible values, you can click on "width". Then hit "Tab" to go to the property value.
1. We enter `30%` into the property value.

## To copy back

Once you are happy with your changes you can copy them in order to put them back in your stylesheet. (Don't forget that any changes you may do in the developer tools are just temporary and will disappear if you reload the page, so if you want to persist a change you have to copy it back into the sources of your webpage in codio.)

1. Go over the styles you want to copy.
1. Start from the bottom , click and select the text while going up
1. Finally use "CTRL + C" or "CMD + C" to copy , or right-click and in the dropdown menu, click "Copy"

## Try it ! 
Go back to the other browser tab we opened to play with the developer tools (or <a href="introduction/index.html" target="_blank">open it again</a> if you closed it) and try changing the `border-radius` of the pictures !
