## Adding styles

You can also add properties on an element. Here we will add width:30% to the img.

1. Either you click just underneath the last property (under `border-radius` here) and it will add a new property.
1. Or you click on the last property value (here `49px;`) to select it and hit the "Tab" key and it will add a new empty property.
1. Then you start typing the property name, here we type "wid" then it offers the possible values, you can click on "width". Then hit "Tab" to go to the property value.
1. We enter `30%` into the property value.
