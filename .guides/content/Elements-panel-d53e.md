## The HTML source view

If you mouse over an element in the HTML (1), it will highlight it in the webpage (2).

## The other way around using the "inspect element" tool

If you click on the little magnifier icon (1) the tool turns into "inspect element" mode.

You can move your mouse over the content of the webpage, here for example over the white bear image and it will highlight it (2), as well as the corresponding html tag in the html source panel (3). This is very practical to find something in your html, starting from it's visual in the webpage.

## Style of an element.

At every moment, when you select an html element, either from the code or using the inspect tool it will show in the style panel (1) all the styles that apply to it.

## The Styles panel

There are 3 main zones in the Styles panel

1. The css style, showing from top to bottom :
    1. "element.style" which is inline style attached to the element.
    1. Style from the external stylesheets
    1. User agent stylesheet (which is the default style the browser has for all elements)
    1. Inherited styles (here from the body tag)
1. The box view which displays in blue the size of the element, its padding (green), its border (yellow) and its margins (orange)
1. Finally the "computed styles" which display the final computed style for the element.
