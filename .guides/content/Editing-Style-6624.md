1. First select an element.
1. The style panel will change to match its styles.
1. Click on any property value in the style panel (here the value for `border-radius`), the value becomes editable.
1. Edit the value until you are satisfied, you can either :
  1. Type any text you want.
  1. Use the arrow keys up and down if the value is numerical to increase and decrease by 1 (or Shift + up and down to in increase/decrease by 10).

When you are satisfied, you can click somewhere else (or hit the esc key)  to apply it.

## Try it ! 
Go back to the other browser tab we opened to play with the developer tools (or <a href="introduction/index.html" target="_blank">open it again</a> if you closed it) and try editing some styles, for example try changing the color or the size of the title or the texts.
