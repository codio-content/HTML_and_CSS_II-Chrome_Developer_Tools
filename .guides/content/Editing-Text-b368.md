## Try it ! 
Go back to the other browser tab we opened to play with the developer tools (or <a href="introduction/index.html" target="_blank">open it again</a> if you closed it) and try editing the text of title or one of the two paragraphs of the page. Don't be afraid to break it. All the changes you make in the developer tools are never saved until you copy them back inside codio, so if you break something, just reload the page !
