At every moment, when you select an html element, either from the code or using the inspect tool it will show in the style panel (1) all the styles that apply to it.

## The Styles panel

There are 3 main zones in the Styles panel

1. The css style, showing from top to bottom :
    1. "element.style" which is inline style attached to the element.
    1. Style from the external stylesheets
    1. User agent stylesheet (which is the default style the browser has for all elements)
    1. Inherited styles (here from the body tag)
1. The box view which displays in blue the size of the element, its padding (green), its border (yellow) and its margins (orange)
1. Finally the "computed styles" which display the final computed style for the element.
