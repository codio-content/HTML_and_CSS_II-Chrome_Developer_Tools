The console allows us to see any messages sent by code. As well as any errors in the page. It is very usefull when something doesn't work as it should.

## Console with an error.

You open the console by clicking on (1).

Here we see that if we load our page with problematic image of the previous section.

There is a line in the console (2) which is red and gives us some information : it tried to "GET" the url [https://...](https://darwin) and didn't find it (404 Not Found).

Also you can see a little red cross with the number 1, it indicates that there is 1 error (3)
